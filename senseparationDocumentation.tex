% ABSTRACT %
%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
The interdisciplinary and experimental project 'Senseparation' focuses on the cross-border networking of people between virtual and real space.
An encounter takes place between two people at different locations, one being an empty, dark room and the other one being an virtual world.
Tactile, visual, and auditory perception are separated and partially blocked for each user, therefore amplifying the remaining senses in order to initiate an unfamiliar and novel kind of encounter.
By means of an avatar, the user in virtual reality is able to interact with the person in
the real space. Emotionless and distant encounters on a virtual level are experienced in a new way.

\section{Introduction}
Intense effort is made in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), looking for possibilities to make the communication with digital data more human and intuitive.
Based on this idea 'Senseparation' was developed: a concept of a telehaptic encounter between two persons in distant places. With 'Senseparation' we decided to go beyond existing projects \ref{???},

mainly focusing on touch and added pictorial visualization and sound. This takes up the well-known habits of an real-life encounter.

As an interdisciplinary and intercity collaborative project, Senseparation intends to discover transpositional sensorial experiences, specificly the cross-border networking of people between virtual and real space.
An encounter takes place between two people in different locations: one being inside a CAVE-like institution and exposed to a virtual world that he/she can navigate through and interact with, the other one being in a dark room stripped off any visual stimulation, and being left only with the sounds made by an audio system and distinct haptic feedback coming from a jacket with vibration motors spread on it that he/she is wearing on his/her body.\\
By this means, tactile, visual, and auditory sensory perceptions are separated between both locations. By this, we hope to amplify the remaining stimuli and create a new, novel way of encounter.

To make communication between both individuals possible, some exchange of information across geographic boundaries is necessary. Therefore data about both users is gathered within the dark room as well as within the CAVE and send over to the other location via network.


TODO: umschreiben: \textit{Multilayer of behaviors in virtual CAVE stimulate the layer of sensation in the dark room correspondingly by mapping the behaviorial infomation onto the feedback suite. Simultaneously the sound system is also modified according to the encounter. By this means of an avatar, the user in virtual reality is able to interact with the person in the real space.}

Senseparation is a collaborative project between the University of Arts and Industrial Design Linz, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. More than 30 people from different fields worked on realizing the whole project.\\
Starting in September 2013, several workshops and presence meetings in Munich and Linz as well as numerous remote-calls guided the individual teams through the process of creating this project.
Different ideas and concepts finally lead into the final concept of separating senses during a distant encounter. With 'Senseparation', arts and technology merge - combining the best of both worlds and creating an novel, immersive installation.


\begin{itemize}
\item motivation
\item{
	general description of the project
	\begin{itemize}
	\item what is it\\
	 ($\rightarrow$ introductory text from wiki... separation of senses, visual, tactile, ...)
	\item dark room side (explanation of dark room: what happens there, what does the user do. Not too technical\\
	 $\Rightarrow$ only the concept)
	\item communication
	(point out, that data gets transmitted over to the cave so that there is a spatial separation as well)
	\item CAVE-side\\
	(how does the interaction in the cave look like? what happens there? How does the room-user affect the cave-environment and vice versa...)
	\end{itemize}
}
\item entire team\\
	  (describe, who worked on the project... what about a complete list of all names in the appendix maybe, like credits in a movie or video game?)
\item aspects: arts vs. technology\\
		(combination of both worlds, merging the best aspects, creating an immersive installation)
\item how we find the concept\\
		(description of the development process $\Rightarrow$ time (October till March... still ongoing to prepare it for future exhibitions...), presence meetings in Munich and Linz aka. Workshops, several Skype-Meetings, different approaches and ideas (interactive table, visualising time, ... , finally: separation of senses) 
\item purpose of this paper
